Description:
PIC16A UCLA project, approximate images using a single closed curve generated by halftoning the image and finding a cycle by solving TSP on the generated stippling points.

The backbone of this project will consist of these major components:

Halftone an arbitrary image and convert points to graph object
Find non self intersection Hamiltonian cycle on nodes by solving TSP using heuristic
Plot the resulting curve

If time permits, these are possible additions:
Smoothen curve using B Splines. 
Implement Concorde TSP solver to make solution more efficient
Add various half toning styles to customize result


Requirements:
ortools and its dependencies.
