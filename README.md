## Description:
PIC16A UCLA project, approximate images using a single closed curve generated by halftoning the image and finding a cycle by solving TSP on the generated stippling points.

The backbone of this project will consist of these major components:

1. Halftone an arbitrary image and convert points to graph object using rejection sampling.
2. Find (ideally) non self-intersecting Hamiltonian cycle on nodes by solving TSP using heuristic.
3. Plot the resulting curve


## Instructions:
To prepare your environment run:

conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt

Using the supplied requirements.txt file.

Furthermore you must install ortools and its dependencies.
